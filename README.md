ðŸ§  Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection Using Machine Learning

This project is focused on building a predictive model to detect Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using various supervised machine learning algorithms. It aims to aid early detection of ASD based on behavioral, neurological, and visual features.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects communication, behavior, and social interaction. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective intervention. This project leverages machine learning models like:

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

SVM was observed to provide the highest accuracy in our testing phase.

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn (for visualization)
